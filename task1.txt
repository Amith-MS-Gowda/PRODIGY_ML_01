Description
This Python script predicts house prices using various regression techniques based on features from a dataset (likely from a Kaggle competition). It implements models such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression, evaluating their performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualizing predictions against actual values.

Key Features
Data Loading: Loads and inspects the dataset from a CSV file.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and optionally applies log transformation to the target variable.
Feature Selection: Uses relevant features like GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, and FullBath.
Train-Test Split: Divides the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Trains multiple regression models and evaluates them using MSE.
Visualization: Creates scatter plots for actual vs. predicted prices and displays feature importance from the Random Forest model.
Cross-Validation: Performs cross-validation to validate the Linear Regression model.
Use Cases
This script is useful for real estate analysis, helping stakeholders understand the impact of property features on pricing and serving as a foundation for predictive modeling tasks.
